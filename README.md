# Smart Fatigue Analysis Of Workers  Using Gait Sequence
 The objective of our project is to create a reliable, non-intrusive system that uses gait cycle analysis and machine learning to detect fatigue in labor workers. By analyzing patterns in workers' gait and face data, we aim to identify early signs of fatigue, allowing for proactive intervention and enhanced safety measures.
